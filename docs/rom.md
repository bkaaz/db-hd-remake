# The cartridge — what is known

A map of what has been found in the original, and how. Why we read it at all:
[ADR 0016](./adr/0016-the-original-is-read-from-the-cartridge.md). Addresses
are confirmed unless marked `?`. A field that code reads gets its address in
that code; this page is for what nothing reads yet.

**The ROM:** `raw/rom/` (BYOA). The dump in use carries a fan translation's
patch (4 MB, header title overwritten); character data sits where PalMod
expects it in the clean Japanese 3 MB dump, so the patch appended rather than
moved. Mapping mode `0x23`: an **SA-1** cartridge — a second 65816 that runs
most of the game logic.

## RAM — the fighter block

In the SA-1's **I-RAM**: player one at `$3100`, player two at `$3200`, the same
field at the same offset. Code reaches a field as `$46,X` with X = `$3100`. The
fields known so far, with what is still a guess marked: `FIGHTER_FIELDS` in
`src/rom/cartridge.ts` (`npm run dis` names them in its output).

Outside the block: `0x80–0x87` and `0x90–0x97` of I-RAM are rectangles (x1,
x2, y1, y2, 16-bit) that follow the drawing `?`; `0x0b2` counts hitstop down.

## ROM

Pointers are 3-byte **LoROM** addresses (`$32:BAE9` is file `0x193ae9`). Goku's
tables, and how a drawing is put together, are in `src/rom/cartridge.ts` and
`src/rom/frame.ts`; `npm run rom` reads them.

| where | what |
|---|---|
| `0xb0000` … | Goku's palettes, 32 bytes each, by stage lighting and side (PalMod) |
| `0x1d8000 + 32 × drawing` | read on every drawing change: `x1 y1 x2 y2` (signed, from the origin) up to `0x80` — drawing `4a` holds a body, a head and the outstretched fist: hurt and hit boxes `?` |
| `0x1e1000 + 32 × drawing` | read beside it, same shape — a second set of boxes `?` |
| `0x27b161` | a second Goku palette, "Hair lighting and KI Blast effects" (PalMod) — not used by the export yet |
| `0x62a15` … | Goku's animation scripts in bank `$0C`: 256 pointers by move id, then the scripts (below) |

**An animation script** is what a move plays: steps that hold a drawing for
some frames, with commands between them — far Y is `02 ee ee  08 46 00
a0 00 06  08 4a 00  04 4a 00  10 46 00  00`, frame for frame what a recording
shows. The engine is at `$01:85FD`; the format, each command's length and what
is known of its meaning are in `src/rom/script.ts`, and the table from move id
to script in `src/rom/cartridge.ts`. `npm run rom -- move 92` prints one;
the export turns each into an animation named `m92` (`src/rom/animation.ts`).

Not read yet: command `80` (move `9d` uses it), and what `a0` / `a1` /
`b0` / `c0` / `e0` set off — the attack ids are where hit data must be. `b0`
spawns an object; the transformation drawings are incomplete without it
(`bugs.md`).

## How it was found

`tools/re/` — Mesen 2 Lua scripts, run from Debug → Script Window with *Allow
access to I/O* on; each writes into `logs/`.

| script | answers |
|---|---|
| `record-ram.lua` | every RAM region and the pad, once per frame — find a value by what was pressed |
| `log-dma.lua` | every DMA, beside the sprite id — where graphics come from |
| `trace-tiles.lua` | every ROM read the SA-1 makes while it fills the tile buffer, in order |
| `trace-anim.lua` | every ROM read around a change of move, step, drawing or tile set |

Measured on Goku (2026-10-28, training mode): walk 1.5 px/frame forward and
1.25 back; jump −9.86 px/frame with gravity 0.469; hitstop 8 frames; the
defender's reaction to a close Y, 21 frames. Health does not fall in training — find it in
a real match.
